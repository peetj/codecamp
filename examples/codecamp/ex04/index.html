      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Its all about Objects - just think about it. We spend the whole day, every day, 7 days a week interacting with/playing with/fiddling with....objects!!
        <br><br>
        What is an object?
        <br><br>
        It is critical that we grasp the concept of an object if we are going to program anything of any consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lesson we are going to build a calculator. It sounds complex but actually it isn't as difficult as it sounds. Firstly we are going to discover how to create an object in javascript. Note that javascript is a very versatile language and there are several ways to create an object. Whilst we may describe the different ways to create an object, we will the concentrate on a particular one.
        <br><br>
        Look at the code fragment below:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        /* Example 1 creates an object using the object literal notation {} */
        var object-1 = {};

        /* You can also create an object with the Object() function */
        var object-2 = new Object();

        /* Finally we see that a function in Javascript is actually an object as well */
        var object-3 = function(){ // does nothing };
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        So <span class="code-inline">object-3</span> doesn't really do a fat lot yet but we can give it some power! Not much I grant you but we can at least make it a bit more interesting.
        <br><br>
        Let's change its name to 'Fido' - if this sounds a bit strange just bear with me!
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        var Fido = {};
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Ok - that's not too hard is it? We have created a variable called 'Fido'. The variable happens to be an object so it is in fact an object variable (as opposed to a numeric variable or a string variable).
        <br><br>
        Now, Fido can't really do anything and doesn't really have any characteristics. Do you have a pet? What kind of characteristics does your pet have eg. colour, weight, hairyness...etc! Let's give Fido some characteristics. How about colour?
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        var Fido = {};

        Fido.colour = "brown";
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Note the 'dot' notation. After the name of the object (Fido) we place a dot (Fido.) The property name "brown" comes after this. "brown" is a string value. Any text value is a string value and must be placed in quotes thus "". You might be thinking that Fido is a dog. I wonder why? Anyway, lets give Fido a property called "breed"
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        var Fido = {};

        Fido.colour = "brown";

        Fido.breed = "spoodle";
      </code></pre>

      <p class="info">
        When we talk about properties of objects, this is the same as saying that the object has certain characteristics. In other words, a property is a characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we are going to add a method to Fido because the poor thing can't actually do anything yet. We are going to add a method/function called 'talk'.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        var Fido = {};

        Fido.colour = "brown";

        Fido.breed = "spoodle";

        Fido.talk = function(){ console.log("Bark! Bark!"); };
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        So, we have a fully functioning dog! Ok maybe not fully functioning but you get the picture.
        <br><br>
        Open up ex04/index.html. We are going to take a look at how we might build a Calculator object
      </p>

      <div class="summary">
        <strong>So, just to recap then:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>We saw that there are different ways to create an object</li>
          <li>We decided to concentrate on the object literal method - the squiggly braces - {}</li>
          <li>We created a dog object called Fido with some properties and a method</li>
          <li>We created a calculator object with an 'add' method</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
